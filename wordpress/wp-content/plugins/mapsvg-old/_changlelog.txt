UPDATING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS:

1. You can safely overwrite contents of folder /wp-contents/plugins/mapsvg -
all maps and settings will be saved because they're located not in files but in
MySQL datebase.

2. If you noticed that after update something is not working right, open the map
in MapSVG Control Panel, carefully check all settings and re-save the map (just
click "Save" button) - this will overwrite "outdated" format of settings with
new one.
